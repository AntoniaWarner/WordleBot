    Program that takes input about the result of a wordle guess and will tell you what the possible answers are with that information

    The program when run asks for the result of your first letter
    If you guessed "crane"and your results were "ddddd" (with "d" being for darkened out letters, y being for yellow letters, and g being for green letters)
    You enter your first result as "c d" where the c represents the C from the guess Crane and the d indicates that the letter does not appear in the word
    The program returns the lists of what it knows about the characters and a list of all still compatible words along with the length of that list.
    The intention is to enter a word of your choice from the list as the next guess.
    From here you can type clear to reset the program (if you got to the correct word) or continue to input the results of your next guess
